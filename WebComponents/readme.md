## Welcome to my Introduction to Web Components 
In this starter project, I am creating a todo list using web components.

## Overview
Having a background using technologies such as React and Vue, I wanted to see
how Web Components would compare in:
- Ease of Use
- Efficiency
- Maintainability  
- etc...

## Plans
While this project is very small and is currently a code pen. I would like to eventually
build my own web component lifecycle library that can be used universally anywhere.
