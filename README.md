# Overview
In this repo, you will find small projects created by me that range from libraries that I use in production to just starter projects I use to tinker with various technologies.

## How To Use
To setup your code pen, copy the `template` directory to wherever you want and rename it.

The base `template` structure:

```
|-- css
|   |-- styles.css 
|
|-- js
|   |-- scripts.js
|
|-- index.html
```
